This version of LTforum can basically work without authentication, but it can be recommended only for test purposes. Somewhere in the future there will be added Access Controller, but for now it's good enough to work together with Apache's Basic Http authentication (and Https).

Instructions:

- Apache's module mod_authz_groupfile must be enabled.

- User data (encripted) are stored in forum_root/LTforum/.users
  I've created some users/passwords: Owl/owl1234, Winnie the Pooh/pooh1234, Tigger/tigger1234, Roo/roo1234
  The command sequence:
    $ cd forum_root/LTforum
    $ htpasswd -cbB users Owl owl1234
    $ htpasswd -bB users "Winnie the Pooh" pooh1234
    $ htpasswd -bB users "Roo" roo1234
    $ htpasswd -bB users "Tigger" tigger1234
    $ mv users ".users"
    -c creates new file, -b orders to take password from command line, -B enforces strong encryption
  
- Permissions for particular folders/forums are set in their .htaccess files
  I've created "demo" and "chat". Example folder .htaccess file:
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Register to forum demo"
    AuthUserFile "/full_path_to_forum_root/LTforum/.users"
    AuthGroupFile "/full_path_to_forum_root/LTforum/.groups"
    Require group demo
    
- Permissions for MessageManager are set in .htaccess in forum root directory:
    <Files rulez.php>
      AuthType Basic
      AuthName "Register to admin panel"
      AuthUserFile "/home/user1/www/LTforum/LTforum/.users"
      AuthGroupFile "/home/user1/www/LTforum/LTforum/.groups"
      Require group admin
    </Files>

- Main script folder /LTforum should contain  .htaccess file as follows:
    <Files *>
      Require all denied
    </Files>
  These scripts are included by php, and are not to be accessed directly from Web
  
- Now we need to create file forum_root/LTforum/.groups and arrange our users, for example:
    demo: "Winnie the Pooh" Tigger Roo
    admin: "Winnie the Pooh" Owl
    chat: Tigger Roo
  
- We can also set "Options +Indexes" for the forum_root folder (and remove the empty index.html), so any visitor will see his allowed forums (and some other stuff like css folder :) )

This construction works wonderfully over HTTPS, but I'm not ready to present the setup instruction, Google knows better :)
